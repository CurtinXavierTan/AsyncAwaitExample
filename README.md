This is repository for Sprint 4 - 5
Task 4.1.2 : Specifically look into Asynchronous programming with async and await (Tasks)

I have created a C# program to experiment Asynichronous programming.
What you will see in the result is that the infinite while loop is executing, but the count operation task I kick off is also running in the background and counting up to 100000.
