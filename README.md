## Description

This is repository for Sprint 4 - 5

Task 4.1.2 : Specifically look into Asynchronous programming with async and await (Tasks)

I have created a simple C# program to experiment Asynichronous programming.

## Getting Started

You can run this using Visual Studio or MonoDevelop.

What you will see in the result is that the infinite while loop is executing, but the count operation task I kick off is also running in the background and counting up to 100000.
